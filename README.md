# Hi Folks!

This readme is for the .github repo *but* the .github repo operates a little differently than most repos. The Readme that folks see when they arrive at [CAWaterBoardDataCenter](https://github.com/CAWaterBoardDataCenter/) **isn't this one!** They are seeing the README.md in the profile folder. [Check it out](https://github.com/CAWaterBoardDataCenter/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) and place your edits there if appropriate.

## What is the purpose of this README?
**Top level SWRCB GitHub Documentation** ... probably
