# Github Governance

This readme is for building out our github gonvernance.

## Top level SWRCB GitHub Documentation that covers our guiding principals, protocols, management decisions, and policies
Also, this is open to discussion. 

### Things that might go in this documnet or in this repo:
1. Data Governanace guiding pricipals and documents
	1. A code of conduct [possibily this one](https://github.com/skills/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
	2. Open data policy documentation
		1. CHHS has a [Open Data Handbook](https://chhsdata.github.io/opendatahandbook/) we might considering forking or adopting in all or part. [Their githubpage](https://github.com/chhsdata/opendatahandbook)
	3. [F(findable) A(accessible) I(interoperable) R(reusable)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
2. Github account management, repo administration, 
	1. Default Account permissions for WaterBoard members and outside collaborators
	2. You can define which individuals or teams own certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file.
	3. Other ideas to implement
		1. Contributing guidlines for internal/external collaborators [possibly this one](https://github.com/skills/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
		2. Justification for creation of Repos
		3. Actions to be taken after the creation of repos.
2. GitHub Wiki
	1.  [NOAA NMFS's Openscapes org](https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes/.github/wiki) - the gathering place for NOAA open science use rather than the actual guidelines (e.g., see the different [licenses used](https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes/.github/wiki/05B-Licenses-for-government-work))
	2. [Other guidelines - NOAA](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/onboarding/github-account/)
	3. We also have [open source guidelines](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/cowi/open_source_code_handbook.html) from the college of water informatics which might be helpful.
3. Data Ethical documentation
	1. [Data ethics stuff: GovOps wrote a Medium article on Data Ethics](https://medium.com/caldata/practical-data-ethics-summary-of-what-were-learning-24d0e9d89cd0) 
	2. [Fed ethics framework is one they mention](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf) 
	3. [FAIR and CARE principles resources are all over the place](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0)
	4. [Here are another couple of things I found that is worth researching](https://directory.civictech.guide/listing/the-odis-data-ethics-canvas)
	5. [CPTF eval toolkit](https://coloradolab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CPTF-Evaluation-Toolkit_June-2021_FINAL.pdf)
4. GitHub useful links an guidlines
	1. [github skills](https://skills.github.com/)
	2. [openscapes git clinic](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/github-pub.html)
	3. Github workflows -
		1. a section on conventions for [commit messages and pull requests](https://style.tidyverse.org/gitgithub.html).
		2. templates/resources/suggestions for project organization and workflow - likely something we customize, or adopt from existing resources
			1. [AP Datakit](https://datakit.ap.org/) is a somewhat generic tool (with separate templates for python, R, and generic projects)
			2. the [workflowr package](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) is an R-specific resource.
	4. others?


Other considerations
1. Data standards might live here or get moved to another location 
	1. Water Data formats
		1. Water Data Consortium's urban supplier data format
		2. WaDE 2. 0 -- [The next version of the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) program. An agreed upon metadata standard and information system for sharing water budget data in the US. Water budgets data include site specific and aggregated water rights, water supplies, use, return flows, and transfers at geospatial areas.](https://github.com/WSWCWaterDataExchange/WaDE2.0)
2. Data use licenses [Open Sources Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)
	1. Creative commons
	2. MIT
	3. atribution
	4. Apache
	5. BSD 
	6. other relevant licenses pre-approved for WB use? 
 3. Coding style guidance
	1. It might be worth pointing to some suggested coding style guides - e.g., for R a good one might be the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).
	2. Related tools for checking and/or reformatting code - e.g., for R the [styler](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) and [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) packages
